### My simple editor theme, Strawberry 🍓

To install for Xcode, place the files in 

```swift
~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes
```

Please note that the light theme is a bit unfinished, since I don't really use it.

### Features:
- instances of classes are a slightly warmer green than structs, making it easier to tell them apart :)
- color is used only where neessary, so the theme doesn't look like a 🎄
- the colors work well together and are very pleasing to look at 🍓😋
